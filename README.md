# Creating lectures using jupyter notebook slides with RISE and reveal.js

You can run the first 'lecture' in an interactive jupyter notebook here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/strawpants/jupylecture/master?filepath=Lecture1Example.ipynb)

This is still work in progress, but might serve as food for thought.

## Todo
* I think about properly exporting the slides shows as static html (this may be relevant for RISE development itself)
